I am a graduate student in the Department of Psychology at University of Pennsylvania where I am co-advised by David Brainard and Geoffrey Aguirre. My current research uses functional magnetic resonance imaging, computational, and behavioral techniques to study the neural basis of cortical color responses. 


Previously I was a lab manager for Kalanit Grill-Spector at Stanford University. During this time, I had two main projects where I examined the development of high-level vision and the microarchitecture of functional regions in human cortex . Prior to being a lab manager,  I was a research assistant for Emily Grossman at UC Irvine where I worked on understanding the neural representation of biological motion.
